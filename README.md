# Spam Filtering Project

This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based spam filtering system. It leverages text preprocessing, data visualization, and various machine learning models to classify messages as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam). The goal is to explore the effectiveness of multiple classification algorithms in detecting spam messages.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Importing and cleaning the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing word frequencies and message lengths for spam and ham messages.
- **Modeling**: Training various classification algorithms and comparing their performance.
- **Prediction**: Testing the models on sample messages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `nltk`, `wordcloud`, `sklearn`
  - `xgboost`
